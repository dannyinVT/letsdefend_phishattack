We’ll return to the SIEM and process this alert.
By following a playbook, we can go step-by-step to break it down further. From our research, it appears the e-mail is indeed malicious and unsolicited. Unfortunately, the e-mail made it pass the spam filter and was delivered to the recipient’s mailbox, increasing the likelihood of infection.
In the following screenshot, network logs were checked to see if outbound connections were made to a C2 server.
 
 
As we can see, contact was made to the IP 188.213.19.81 and was allowed.
